# LogParser Pro

**LogParser Pro** is a Python-based command-line tool for parsing, filtering, and analyzing log files. It demonstrates object-oriented programming, Python decorators, and unit testing practices as part of my preparation for the Amazon Systems Development Internship 2025.

  - Log level (e.g., `INFO`, `ERROR`)
  - Date (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
